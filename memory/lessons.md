# Lessons Learned (Mistakes & Fixes)

## WebSocket Centralization
- **Mistake**: Initially added WebSocket script only to `dashboard.html`.
- **Lesson**: Trading bots need real-time data on multiple pages (Ledger, Portfolio). Always centralize WebSocket logic in `base.html` and use `data-instrument` attributes for generic updates.

## Historical Data Consistency
- **Mistake**: Added new fields to `Trade` model but didn't populate them for existing trades.
- **Lesson**: When adding metadata fields (like strike price), always run a "healing" script to update existing records if possible, so the UI stays consistent.

## Upstox IP Restrictions
- **Mistake**: Interpreting 403 Forbidden as just an Auth error.
- **Lesson**: Upstox error `UDAPI1154` specifically means Static IP restriction. Always provide clear UI instructions for the user to fix this in the developer portal.
